"Alerted movement, conscious flight.
Directionless vector of so little. 
Wrongfully lauded tearfully by shadows running from the. light.
Tomorrow will be great. Now is awful. Today is meaningless. 
We are so far from the conference. 

In it, sound and colours. 
They joyfully experience it all in the cave.
Venturing towards it would be betraying the others. 
Tomorrow is meaningless. Now is uncertain. Today will be great. 
We are the conference."
